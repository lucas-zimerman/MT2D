# MT2D
Monochrome Text 2D Engine is a Multiplatform console based development where you can make a better use of your hardware while maintaining compatibility with many operational systems.
With MT2D you'll be provided with alot of build in functions to make your life easier like:
-Message Boxes, Input Boxes, Keyboard/Joystick Interaction, System Delays, menu system and even more.

As an aditional bonus MT2D also has a core for making games and complex menus systems, this includes the support of playing wave sounds and rendering sprites (for now limited on platforms where SDL can run)

The Working operational systems are:
-MS-DOS (image sprites and non PC spekaer sound files doesn't work)
-Windows (PC speaker sounds weird in 7 or higher, for rendering sprites that arent ASCII you'll need SDL)
-Linux (better used with SDL, the support for native terminal is kinda limited and its not working at the moment)
-MacOS (never tested but it should be at the same situation as Linux)
-Windows Phone 8/10 (Working if used with the SDL lib)
-Android (Under testing, but it should work if used with the SDL lib)
-Ios (never was tested on it)

Here are some youtube videos from softwares that were Developed using MT2D:
