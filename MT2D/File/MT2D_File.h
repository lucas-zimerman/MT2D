	MT2D_File.h created by: Lucas Zimerman Fraulob
	
	Here's a simple multiplatform file handler using basic functions
	for interacting with local files and container files.
	
	MT2D File Open
		Description: Opens a file
		Args:
		-filePath: the path where MT2D is gonna open your file.
		-mode: an ASCII string representing the mode to be used for 
		opening the file; (the same as the ANSI C modes form the FILE
		struct)
	
	MT2D File Close
		Description: Closes a file
	
	MT2D File Read Byte
		Description: Read a byte from a file, return 0 in case of EOF or error
	
	MT2D File Read
		Description: Read x bytes from a given file, return 0 in case of EOF or error.
		Args:
		-file: the file to be loaded.
		-inBufferPtr: the buffer where the data will be stored after readed.
		-size: size of the buffer in bytes.
		-maxNum: the maximum number of objects to be read.

	MT2D File Seek
		Description: seeks to offset relative to whence whence may 
		be any of the following values:
			SEEK_SET: seek from the beginning of data
			SEEK_CUR: seek relative to current read point
			SEEK_END: seek relative to the end of data
		Return: If successful, the function returns zero.
		Otherwise, it returns -1.
		Args:
		-file: the file to be seeked.
		-offset: an offset in bytes, relative to whence location; 
		can be negative.
		-whence: any of SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END
		
	MT2D File Write
		Description: Write data under the given file, return the
		number of the objects that were written.
		Args:
		-file: the file to be written, in the last set offset.
		-outBufferPtr: a pointer to a buffer containing data to write.
		-size: the size of an object to write, in bytes
		-count: the number of objects to write

	MT2D File Write Byte
		Description: Write a byte under the given file.
		Return: the written byte on sucess
		Args:
		-file: the file to be written, in the last set offset.

	MT2D File Tell
		Description: get the current read/write offset in a file
		Return: the current offset, -1 on error.
		Args:
		-file: the file to be checked

	NOTE: Do not try to use the internal data inside the MT2D_FILE
	since it may change acording to the OS or Libraries.
	Intead, use the given functions to do what you need to.
