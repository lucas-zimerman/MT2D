/* State.h , created by: Lucas Zimerman Fraulob

        The state is an important part of ObjectCore because it allows the programmer
        to add "BRAIN" to the object, allowing it to follow a step by step order of 
        showing sprites and executing Cscript calls.

        This struct is shared by the objects and isn't replicated for each object
        (since all its data are "const" you can even use it in threads).

  A state contains a set of sprites, a function call and a timer.
  A label contains a set of states.
