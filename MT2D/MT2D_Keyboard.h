                                        Keyboard.cpp / Keyboard.h

                                                                Created By Lucas Zimerman Fraulob
        With this code you'll be able to make use of the Keyboard for your software on an universal way
        For now MS-DOS, Windows and linux had their keyboard code standardized, for key codes, check getch output
        on Windows or the ansi struct.
        NOTE: there's also an experimental SDL code for the keyboard part, so it may not propertly work for now

        List of functions and what they do and their returns:

        -Keynboard_touched()
                Description: Check if the keyboard was touched (good for loops not getting stucked on keyboard_keytouched.
                Return: 1 if the keyboard was touched, 0 if the keyboard wasn't touched.

        -Keyboard_keytouched()
                Description: Return what key was pressed, if none was pressed, it'll wait for a key,
                        also, if a special key was pressed like _key, this function will make two returns, one indicating that
                        _key was pressed and then witch _key was pressed.
                Return: Key pressed (ansi char)
        NOTE: if you want to interact with multiple keys at the same time, please use the joystick struct
        because it also works with keyboard.
